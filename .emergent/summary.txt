The previous AI engineer successfully evolved THE BAR. website from an MVP to a feature-rich application. Initially, the focus was on core design, mobile responsiveness, and UX, including bug fixes for cursor and date picker, and enhancements like toast notifications and form validation. Subsequent development involved significant content and structural updates. The engineer integrated new Hotová řešení packages, updated the contact form dropdown label, refined testimonial avatars with consistent user icons, and introduced a new Svatební Balíček section with distinct pricing tiers and a bonus card. Bug fixes for broken images and icons were addressed promptly. Most recently, comprehensive multilingual support was added for English, Russian, and Ukrainian, involving  integration, translation file creation, language switcher implementation, and extensive content translation across all sections, including a critical debugging of a JSON syntax error.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer completed the implementation of full multilingual support for the website. This was a multi-step process:

1.  **Installation**:  and  were installed via yarn install v1.22.22
[1/4] Resolving packages...
[2/4] Fetching packages...
[3/4] Linking dependencies...
[4/4] Building fresh packages...
success Saved lockfile.
Done in 0.40s..
2.  **Configuration**: A new  file was created to configure the i18n instance, specifying  (Czech) as the default language and  (English) as a fallback, and setting up resource loading for translation files. This configuration was then imported into .
3.  **Translation Files**: New JSON files were created in  for Czech (), English (), Russian (), and Ukrainian (). The existing Czech content from  was extracted into  as the base.
4.  **Language Switcher Component**: A new  component was created in  to provide a UI element (dropdown with flags and language codes) for users to switch languages.
5.  **Integration**: The  component was integrated into , specifically placed in the top-right header for both desktop and mobile navigation.
6.  **Content Translation**: Extensive refactoring was performed in  to replace hardcoded strings with  function calls, covering the Hero section, About Us, both Hotová řešení and Svatební Balíček sections, navigation, forms, and GDPR content. Automated translations were used for English, Russian, and Ukrainian as a placeholder.
7.  **Debugging**: An important JSON parsing error caused by curly quotes in  was identified and fixed, ensuring the frontend compiled successfully.
8.  **Verification**: Screenshots confirmed the language switcher's presence and initial functionality, showing content translated into English. The testing agent also provided a comprehensive summary confirming full functionality across all languages and devices.

The last message states: Status: MULTILINGUAL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✅.
