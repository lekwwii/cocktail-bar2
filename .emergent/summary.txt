The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and iteratively developed a luxury cocktail catering website for THE BAR. based on detailed product requirements. The work trajectory shows a clear pattern of initial build-out, followed by multiple rounds of user feedback and subsequent refinements. Key aspects include leveraging React and TailwindCSS for the frontend, utilizing  for image sourcing, and implementing advanced design principles like glass-morphism, parallax scrolling, and sophisticated typography. The engineer demonstrated proficiency in applying design aesthetics, localizing the content to Czech, and integrating complex UI components such as a promotional modal with a date picker. Debugging efforts for JSX syntax errors were also noted. However, two critical issues—the blinking text cursor and the date picker not closing on external clicks—persisted through the last interaction, indicating a need for more robust or targeted solutions, which was the focus of the engineer's work immediately before this summary.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: This is the central component that renders the entire website. It contains all sections (Hero, About Us, Our Offer, Gallery, Client Reviews, Contact, Footer), navigation, and the promotional modal. It manages the website's layout, content, and interactive elements.
    -   **Summary of changes made**: This file has undergone extensive modifications throughout the development trajectory. Initially, it was created to lay out the full structure as per requirements, incorporating responsive design and basic styling. Subsequent updates included:
        *   Implementation of the dark theme, premium fonts (Playfair Display, Inter), and animations (hover, scroll).
        *   Integration of images from  into various sections.
        *   Fixes for UI bugs like the hero section content disappearance and the white line under the navbar on scroll.
        *   Enhancements to the social media links and removal of legacy WhatsApp elements.
        *   Updates to business statistics and addition of company details in the footer.
        *   Refinements to the header navigation (logo text, sizing, spacing) and the Quick Response WhatsApp section (visual styling, button type, hover effects).
        *   Introduction of a maximum content width and visual framing effects (gradients, gold lines) for a gallery-like appearance.
        *   Complete localization of all website text into Czech, including dynamic content and pricing.
        *   Implementation of the promotional popup modal with specific content, form fields, trigger logic (scroll/time), and smooth animations.
        *   Refinements to the date picker within the modal for better UX and styling.
        *   Global application of new font styles and various attempts to fix the blinking text cursor and date picker closing bugs, involving changes to event listeners and cursor properties.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: This file holds custom CSS rules that extend or override TailwindCSS defaults to achieve specific visual effects and animations not easily covered by utility classes.
    -   **Summary of changes made**: This file was modified to define custom CSS keyframes for animations (e.g., ,  for the modal) and to apply  for glass-morphism effects. It also includes global cursor overrides ( for general elements,  for inputs) as part of the attempt to fix the text cursor bug.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Configures the TailwindCSS framework, allowing for custom theme extensions, color palettes, font definitions, and other utility class generation.
    -   **Summary of changes made**: This file was updated to define the custom color palette (black, deep navy, champagne gold), add specific  utilities like , and configure the  for Playfair Display and Inter, ensuring they are available as Tailwind classes and linking to Google Fonts. It also defines custom animation names for use with CSS keyframes.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Blinking Text Cursor Bug**: The blinking vertical text cursor appears globally, even in non-input areas. This needs to be fully resolved, ensuring the cursor only appears inside actual input fields.
-   **Date Picker Closing Behavior**: The calendar popup does not close when clicking outside of it and currently requires an explicit click inside the field again. This needs to be fixed to close smoothly on outside clicks.
-   *Optional for Date Picker*: Add fade-in/out animation and ensure  format for Czech locale.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on resolving two critical, persistent bugs identified by the user: the **blinking text cursor (caret line)** appearing site-wide, and the **date picker (calendar field) not closing correctly** when clicking outside.

The last completed action was a  (Chat Message 129), presumably targeting the  file to implement fixes for these issues. Following this edit, the AI engineer explicitly stated the next action: Now let me fix the JavaScript to properly handle the date picker closing and prevent any focus issues (Chat Message 130).

This indicates that the current focus is on client-side JavaScript logic within  to:
1.  Implement an event listener or blur handling for the date picker component that detects clicks outside its area and triggers its closure.
2.  Refine focus management and cursor behavior across the application to ensure the text cursor only activates within form input fields and not on general page elements, likely building upon previous CSS rules.

The code is in a state where these specific JavaScript and possibly minor CSS adjustments are being applied to rectify the reported UI anomalies. The  file, which contains the main modal component and general site structure, is the primary focus of these ongoing fixes.

<optional_next_step>
Implement the JavaScript logic in  to ensure the date picker closes on clicking outside, and thoroughly verify the text cursor behavior across the entire website to confirm it only appears within actual input fields.
